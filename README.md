# website
This is the README file for the website I created for a tutoring center. My mom forced me to make this website. This website is licensed under Apache License, so feel free to use it if you find it useful.

The website is a simple landing page that introduces the tutoring center, its services, its tutors, and its contact information. 

The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The website is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the source code is available on my GitHub repository. You can clone or fork the repository and make your own changes if you want. Just make sure to follow the Apache License terms and conditions.

The tutoring center may or may not exist in real life. My mom  wanted me to make a website for her imaginary tutoring center. She said it would be good for something?
